There is now some small attempt at prioritisation in this file, higher priority
stuff should be at the top of the file, lower priority at the bottom.

	Bugs:
	- Make sure network client doesn't get unlimited shots.

	Features:
	- Add scroll bar to buying screen.
	- Add randomize button to buying screen to have items automatically
	  purchased.
	- Field repair kit: Spend a turn to repair your tank rather than fire.
          Limited uses, heals more than Auto Repair Kit.
	- Radar resistant missile: A missile designed to avoid the missile defence
	      system by masking its heat signature.
          Yield: Large missile
	- Update client ground surface more often.
	- Client needs a buying screen.
	- Add rocks as semi-destructable items.


===============================================

	   Items from here to the bottom of the file
	   are under consideration by the development
	   team and may (or may not) be implemented.

===============================================


	-- under ground mines

	-- rocket like fireworks

	-- Make it possible to shoot down the UFO

	-- Make main window scalable
           (Needs to wait until Allegro 5.x)
           -> Allegro 5 is a no-opt. And porting to SFML-2 or SDL2 would be
              a major rewrite of the game. But maybe one day.

	-- Harder ground
           -> What is that supposed to mean?

	-- High voltage missiles (discharge on impact or when within range)
		(Bharat Dhareshwar)

	-- Tornadoes (pick up tanks and objects) (Bharat Dhareshwar)

	-- Another level of armour improvement
